# RoProxy
A tool built for Synapse X to assist in Roblox client packet recording.

# Timeline
Right now, RoProxy only hooks Roblox GET requests made by the client (I know, it's weird) and thus only tracks Roblox reports, API calls, screenshot requests, etc..

I plan to add packet support when I find an implementation for it.
